        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p className="updated">Last updated 25 September 2026</p>

        <p>
          These terms cover the Napkin plugin and the service at
          napkin-neon.vercel.app, published by dzhunka. Installing or calling
          the plugin means accepting them.
        </p>

        <h2>What the service is</h2>
        <p>
          Napkin is a free, noncommercial plugin. It opens a blank napkin in
          your agent&apos;s conversation so you can sketch something instead of
          describing it. There is no fee, no account, no subscription, and no
          paid tier.
        </p>

        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>
          The plugin and its endpoint may change, and the service may be
          interrupted or withdrawn at any time without notice. Do not rely on
          it where an interruption would cause harm.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          Use the service through a supported agent host, as intended. Do not
          attempt to overload, probe, or disrupt the endpoint, and do not use it
          to produce content that is unlawful or that infringes someone
          else&apos;s rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          What you draw is yours, and so is the responsibility for it. Your
          sketch goes from the napkin to your agent host, not to Napkin, which
          neither reviews nor stores it.
        </p>

        <h2>No warranty</h2>
        <p>
          The service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
          available&rdquo;, without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
          including fitness for a particular purpose and uninterrupted or
          error-free operation.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, the publisher is not liable
          for any indirect, incidental, or consequential loss arising from use
          of the service, including lost data, lost profits, or decisions made
          on the basis of a sketch or of an agent&apos;s reading of one.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes and contact</h2>
        <p>
          Updated terms will be published on this page with a new date.
